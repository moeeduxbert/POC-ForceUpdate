This Proof of Concept (POC) project demonstrates how to implement a force update mechanism in mobile applications using Microsoft's CodePush service. Force updates ensure that users are always using the latest version of the app, enhancing security, reliability, and user experience.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Microsoft's CodePush service for over-the-air updates.
- Ability to enforce mandatory updates for critical fixes and feature enhancements.
- Customizable update prompts and user messaging.
- Support for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with mobile application development for Android and iOS platforms.
- Basic understanding of over-the-air update services and deployment strategies.
- CodePush account and access tokens for integration (Refer to the CodePush documentation for setup instructions).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moeeduxbert/POC-ForceUpdate.git
   ```

2. Follow the instructions provided in the respective directories for Android and iOS implementations.

## Usage

- Integrate the provided CodePush logic into your mobile application codebase.
- Customize update policies, version checks, and user prompts according to your application's requirements.
- Test the force update mechanism thoroughly across different scenarios before deploying to production.
